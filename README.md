# Project Brief: CSS Button Animation - CodeSpace Magic Buttons

## Hello Codespacers!

Are you ready for a fun, interactive challenge? Dive into the world of CSS animations and transitions with the Magic Buttons project! Here, you'll be tasked with picking three button animations from a given reference and recreating them. It's an exciting way to consolidate your knowledge of CSS and get a glimpse into the dynamic potential of web interactivity.

## **Clarify the Learning Objectives**  
*By the end of this project, you will be able to:*  
- Create visually appealing button animations using CSS, adding hover, focus, and click effects for interactivity.
- Understand the mechanics behind CSS transitions and animations and apply them effectively.
- Replicate design ideas from a given reference.

## Project Objectives:

Estimated Time to Complete: 3 hours

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Create visually appealing button animations using CSS.
- Understand the mechanics behind CSS transitions and animations.
- Implement hover, focus, and click effects on buttons.
- Replicate design ideas from a reference and adapt them to your style.

## Project Requirements:

1. **Choose Your Animations**: Browse through the provided reference to choose three button animations that catch your eye.

Check out the Codespace Academy Codepen reference for choosing your buttons here: https://codepen.io/codespace-academy/pen/xxmWrjX

## Copy and Paste Alert!!!
Note: You have full access to the code provided to create these button animations in the CodePen reference above. But! The point of this project is not to copy and paste the code but to choose how you want your buttons to look and to code them yourself. It's easy to search the internet and find the exact code you need but we want you to try and create these animations from scratch and play around with them and have fun. It will be easy for your code coaches to see that you have merely copy and pasted your code, so give yourself a challenge and have fun creating button animations of your own. Even if your CSS ends up being longer than the possible solutions given, you will learn a lot more by attempting the solution yourself.

2. **HTML Structure**: Create an HTML structure for your buttons. This is your foundation upon which the animations will come alive!

3. **CSS Animations & Transitions**: Here's the challenge:
   - Implement hover effects for a delightful user hover experience.
   - Focus on ensuring smooth and visually appealing transitions.
   - Explore the use of `@keyframes` for more complex animations.

4. **Aesthetics Matter**:
   - Beyond the animation, ensure your buttons are styled elegantly. Think about their color, typography, and overall design.
   - Aim for a consistent theme across all three buttons, even if the animations are different.

5. **Comments and Documentation**:
   - Your CSS will be bustling with activity. Ensure you comment your code clearly, explaining the rationale behind your animation choices and any challenges you faced.

## Deliverables:

1. **Animated Buttons CodePen**: Your primary deliverable is a Codepen showcasing your three animated buttons. They should be interactive and react to user actions.

2. Provide a brief summary of your design and animation choices as well as reflect on what you've learned and the fun (or frustration!) you had during the process. Integrate these reflections into your CSS comments.

## Grading Criteria:

Your project will be assessed based on:

- Accuracy in replicating the chosen button animations from the reference.
- Fluidity and visual appeal of the animations.
- Aesthetics and design consistency of the buttons.
- Organized, well-commented CSS code.
- Reflections on the animation choices and learning process.

## Additional Notes:

- While the challenge is to replicate, feel free to add your personal twist or flair to the animations.
- If you're seeking an added layer of complexity, consider incorporating multiple animation properties, such as scale, rotate, or skew, in your buttons.

Get ready to embark on an animated adventure and bring static buttons to vibrant life. Enjoy the project, and may your buttons always be magical!

# A beginner's guide to CodePen

CodePen is a fantastic tool for experimentation, learning, and showcasing your front-end development skills. By following these steps, you can easily create, customize, and share your work with the CodePen community or across the web.

Creating and sharing a CodePen is a straightforward process that allows you to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and see the results instantly. Here's a simple guide to get you started:

## Creating a CodePen
1. Sign Up or Log In

- If you're new to CodePen, sign up for an account at CodePen.io.
- If you already have an account, simply log in.

2. Start a New Pen

- Once logged in, click on the “Create” button, usually found in the top right corner, and select “New Pen.”

3. Write Your Code

You'll see three boxes: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Enter your code in the respective boxes.
As you type, the output will be displayed in the live view window.

4. Save Your Pen

- Click the “Save” button to save your work. You'll need to give your Pen a title and can optionally add a description and tags for better discoverability.

## Customizing Your Pen
Change Settings: Use the settings icon in each section (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to add preprocessors like Sass for CSS or Babel for JavaScript, or to include external libraries.

Layout: Adjust the layout of the editor and preview panes according to your preference.

# Sharing Your Pen

1. Public or Private
- Pens can be set to public or private. Private Pens are available only on paid plans. 
- Note that all your CodeSpace submissions will need to be public so that your coach can access them. 
- Comments: Users can comment on your Pen if you enable comments, providing feedback or suggestions.

2. Share the Link
- Once your Pen is saved, you can share it by copying the URL from your browser’s address bar.
- Alternatively, use the “Share” button on the Pen to get a shortened link.
